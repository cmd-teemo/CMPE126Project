# CMPE126Project
This project aims to integrate and apply the concepts of data structures and algorithms covered in CMPE126, including queues, stacks, linked lists, binary trees, hashing, STL, sorting, and searching algorithms. The project will allow students to creatively design and implement a solution in C++ while solidifying their understanding of the material.
